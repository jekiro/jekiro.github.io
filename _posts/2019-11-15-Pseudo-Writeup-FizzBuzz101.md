title: "HTB Pseudo Writeup by FizzBuzz101"

Pseudo is the toughest challenge on HTB in my opinion as of 2019 (well, before headachev2 released). Nothing even comes close to this reversing challenge, which centers around an aarch64 and VM crackme. Before I start, I would like to thank davidlightman for working on it with me. He taught me many new reversing tricks and, oftentimes, managed to see things which I missed.
