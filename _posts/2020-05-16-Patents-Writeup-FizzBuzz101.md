excerpt: "Patents was quite a difficult box from gb.yolo (who's now a teammate of mine!) with a realistic pwn in the end.  Overall, it was a very enjoyable box that took a while!  Before I start, I would like to thank D3v17 and pottm, my teammates who worked with me on this box.  Additionally, I would like to thank oep, Sp3eD, R4J, and Deimos who I collaborated with at times throughout and after the box."
