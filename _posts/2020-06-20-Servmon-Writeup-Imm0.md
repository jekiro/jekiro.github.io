excerpt: "Throughout this writeup we’ll see how just a little bit of additional information allows us to effectively abuse a directory traversal vulnera- bility in way too old software. Going forward, we’ll use credentials obtained to look around the system to discover credentials for yet another application. Abusing an inherent flaw in the application design we’ll obtain SYSTEM privileges and ultimately take over the box. After we finished the hassle we’ll look at an alternative, easier, and more reliable route dmw0ng told me about after I solved the box and for style points use RDP to log into the system."
