### Challenge Information

Challenge: wintendo-nii  
Created by: imyxh

>Someone gave me this weird knockoff game console and I think it's hiding a flag. I managed to dump the firmware and host it on this server; can you take it from here?

## Basic Research

Beginning basic analysis on the program, running file shows that it's a `64 bit executable ELF`.

>nii: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=8def7e412da3017e4dd7fcf2c2d6ad0ac37ba8e4, stripped

The binary is statically linked and stripped, which would make sense because the binary is firmware. And running it, it prints some Chinese and takes user input but closes right after.
